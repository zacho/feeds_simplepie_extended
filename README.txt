Feeds SimplePie Extended
========================

This module provides a Feeds Parser class which extends the stock 
FeedsSimplePieParser.inc parser by providing additional mapping sources.

Mapping Sources:

* Link Contents
  -------------
  Fetches the contents of the feed item <link> and provides full-text 
  as a mapping source.

That is all.
